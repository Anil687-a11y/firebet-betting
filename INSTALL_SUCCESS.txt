All dependencies have been installed successfully!

📦 What was installed:
   ✓ Backend dependencies (Express, MongoDB, JWT, etc.)
   ✓ Frontend dependencies (React, Router, Icons, etc.)
   ✓ Development tools (Concurrently, Nodemon)

⚠️ About the warnings:
   The npm warnings you saw are normal and don't affect the app.
   They're just deprecation notices for some sub-dependencies.
   Your app will work perfectly fine!

🚀 NEXT STEPS:

   1. Start the app:
      → Double-click: start.bat (Windows)
      → Or run: npm run dev

   2. Open browser:
      → Go to: http://localhost:3000

   3. Create account:
      → Click Register
      → Fill in your details
      → Verify email (check console for code)

   4. Start testing!

📝 IMPORTANT NOTES:

   • Backend runs on: http://localhost:5000
   • Frontend runs on: http://localhost:3000
   • MongoDB is already connected (Atlas cloud)
   • Email verification code will show in terminal
     (since email service is not configured yet)

🔧 IF YOU GET ERRORS:

   Port already in use?
   → Close other apps using port 5000 or 3000
   → Or change PORT in .env file

   Cannot connect to MongoDB?
   → Check .env file has correct connection string
   → Verify MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist

   Module not found?
   → This shouldn't happen now, but if it does:
   → Run: npm install (in root folder)
   → Run: npm --prefix client install (for frontend)
